# Project 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Resources

* [Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)
* [Multiple Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance)
* [Inheritance in Python](https://hub.packtpub.com/inheritance-python/)
* [Inheritance Magic Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8kCdLCi6Lk)

## Geeneral Learning Objectives

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

## General Requirements

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

### Task 0.
Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object

### Task 1.
Write a class MyList that inherits from list

### Task 2. 
Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False

### Task 3.
Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise False

### Task 4.
Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False

### Task 5.
Write an empty class BaseGeometry

### Task 6.
Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py)

### Task 7.
Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py)

### Task 8.
Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).

### Task 9.
Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)

### Task 10.
Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)

### Task 11.
Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py)
